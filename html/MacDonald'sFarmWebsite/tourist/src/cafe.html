	Delight in Caffe Aroma handcrafted coffee beans, made with love and the finest ingredients. It’s a small cafe, not somewhere you could realistically spend a lot of time, but it does have outdoor seating. What I will say is it seems to have a very good selection of sandwiches and cakes, and by ‘good’ I mean ‘varied’ – not just cheese and ham. I can’t comment on the coffee, but I had a pretty decent hot chocolate and a chocolatey cake thing. They also do breakfast, which several people kept trying to buy despite it being lunchtime – check the time on your watch!
    Relax with quality food and beverages in a picturesque setting...
