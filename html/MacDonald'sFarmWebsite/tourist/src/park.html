	  Edinburgh, UK is Scotland’s compact, hilly capital.Edinburgh’s Old and New Towns, divided by the broad Princes Street Gardens, were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 listed buildings within the city. The Old Town runs downhill and terminates at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or wynds) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern The West End includes the financial district, and the Edinburgh International Conference Centre. If you’d like to have an in-person guided running experience in Edinburgh, we highly recommend our friends at Go! Running Tours.
