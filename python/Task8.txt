Task8:

Write your description of the fetch execute cycle below: You may include a diagram as well.

Answer:

The fetch-execute cycle is the fundamental process through which a computer executes programs. It
involves several components, including the processor (CPU), memory and buses.

Software Design and Development J27C 76
• Processor (CPU): It is the brain of the computer and executes instructions. It consists of Arithmetic
Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit ( CU) and registers.
• Memory: it stores both data and instructions that the CPU needs to execute. Memory is divided into
RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read Only Memory)
• Buses: are pathways that allow data and instructions to travel between the CPU, memory and other
components of the computer. The primary buses involved in the fetch execute cycle are the address
bus, data bus and control bus.
The fetch-execute cycle process:
• Fetch:
The CPU fetches the next instruction from memory. It sends the memory address of the next
instruction over the address bus.
• Decode:
The Control Unit decodes the fetched instruction, determining what operation needs to be
performed and what data, if any, is required.
• Execute:
The decoded instruction is executed by the ALU or other relevant components of the CPU. This
could involve performing arithmetic or logical operations, accessing data from memory, or
transferring data between registers.
• Write back:
If the executed instruction produces a result that needs to be stored back in memory or a register,
the CPU writes this result back to the appropriate location.

This cycle continues repeatedly, with the CPU fetching, decoding, and executing instructions until the program
terminates or encounters an error. The coordination of these activities is facilitated by the control signals sent
over the control bus, ensuring that the instructions are executed in the correct sequence and at the correct time.
